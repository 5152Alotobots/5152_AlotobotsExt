# FIRST Robotics Team 151 Extension Pack

## Nashua Tough Techs

FIRST Robotics Team 151, [The Nashua Tough Techs](https://nashua151.org/wp/) is FIRST community team based in Nashua, New Hampshire. Our team is a registered 501(c)3 non-profit and was founded in 1992. We are committed to our mission of exposing students wo a hand-on experience in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).

## Purpose of this extension pack

Installs extensions needed when using the the Tough Techs robot-template. The template itself is public and can be found at our Github account in the [robot-template](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template) Git repository. Each extension is included specifically to make life easier for the High School students on our team when coding each year's robot. The template includes a settings.json file to configure the extensions in the way the template presupposes. These settings may not always be to a users liking, but we err on the side of ease of use so that we do not have a lot of extra configuration work required. As it is there is more than we would like.

This extension pack presumes that the user will be using the VSCode environment that is installed by the [WPILIB software](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases) package used by FIRST each year, as documented in the [WPILIB Javadocs](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/index.html) and [control system docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/), for use in the [FIRST Robotics](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) annual competition.

## Extensions included

Since it is expected that this extension pack will be used in the WPILIB environment, it does not install any of the extensions pre-installed in that environment. However, it does not enforce that, since we think the extensions included in this pack make a useful development environment by themselves and anyone who wants to use them outside of the WPILIB environment is more than welcome to do so. We do suggest looking at the various files under the [.vscode directory in the robot-template](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template/tree/main/.vscode) repository, particularly the [settings.json](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) and [tasks.json](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json) files for hints on how it might be used in your environment. You should probably also look at the documents in the [Docs directory](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template/tree/main/Docs).

## Further setup required for our students to use the robot-template

Once the extensions are installed, there are some further configuration changes needed to use the robot-template properly according to our workflow. The steps are in the VSCode.md file, in the section [Configure setting for VSCode with extensions](https://github.com/ToughTechs151/robot-template/blob/main/Docs/VSCode.md#configure-settings-for-vscode-with-extensions).
